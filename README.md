# Minecraft Tools Generated By LLM

中文版见同目录下的 `README_zh_hans.md`

A collection of Minecraft-related tools developed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs). These tools are designed to help Minecraft players and developers manage and enhance their Minecraft experience.

## Overview
- `log2msg.py`: A tool to parse Minecraft log files and extract chat messages, saving them in a clean text format. Really great to filter out the noise in the log files and focus on the chat content.
- `asset_extractor.py`: A tool to extract assets from Minecraft resource packs and mods. Sometimes you just want to get the textures or sounds without loading the whole game.
- W.I.P. More tools will be added in the future. (by LLM.. ...)

## How to Run

Each tool is a standalone Python script. You can run them from the command line. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. They don't require any special libraries so far.

For example, to run the `log2msg.py` tool, you would use a command like this:

```bash
python3 log2msg.py -i path/to/minecraft/logs/latest.log -o path/to/output/clean_chat.txt
```

That will read the specified Minecraft log file and output the cleaned chat messages to the specified text file.

## Acknowledgements
Hmm... I guess I should thank the LLMs that helped me write these tools. Without them, I would probably still be stuck in the world of Minecraft, trying to figure out how to extract assets manually.

DeepSeek wrote the most of the code.

GitHub Copilot helped to write the README file and fixed some small issues.

I brought up the idea of using LLMs to assist in the development of these tools.
