# Minecraft CLI Tools Generated By LLM

[中文版](https://github.com/difficult-to-have-name/llm-mc-tools/blob/main/README_zh_hans.md)见同目录下的 `README_zh_hans.md`

A collection of Minecraft-related CLI (command-line interface) tools developed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs). These tools might come in handy sometimes.

## Overview
- `log2msg.py`: Parse Minecraft log files and extract chat messages, saving them in a clean text format. Really great to filter out the noise in the log files and focus on the chat content.
- `asset_extractor.py`: Extract asset files from Minecraft game.
- W.I.P. More tools will be added in the future. (by LLM.. ...)

## How to Run

Each tool is a standalone Python script. You can run them from the command line. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. Furthermore, you need to install some dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these dependencies.

For example, to run the `log2msg.py` tool, you would use a command like this:

```bash
python3 log2msg.py -i path/to/minecraft/logs/latest.log -o path/to/output/clean_chat.txt
```

That will read the specified Minecraft log file and output the cleaned chat messages to the specified text file.

## Acknowledgements
Hmm... I guess I should thank the LLMs that helped me write these tools. Without them, I would probably still be stuck in the world of Minecraft, trying to figure out how to extract assets manually.

- DeepSeek wrote the most of the code.
- GitHub Copilot helped to write the README file and fixed some small issues.
- I brought up the idea of using LLMs to assist in the development of these tools.
